This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

###Limitations
1. Eval() is not always the most secure method, however for speed of build in this case I opted to use it
2. If a number with too many digits is entered or returned users will receive an `ERROR`
3. no mixed operators note, but I do believe the code is clear as is.

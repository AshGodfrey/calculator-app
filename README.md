### To Run Locally

Run  
`npm install`
`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Limitations
1. Eval() is not always the most secure method, however for speed of build in this case I opted to use it
2. If a number with too many digits is entered or returned users will receive an `ERROR`
